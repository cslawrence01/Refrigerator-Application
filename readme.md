- List ingredients (stretch- include expiration dates)-Database(flask)
- - Ideally, will have user input items and dates go to Database and then get processed closest expiration dates and then passed through to generate api url
- provide recipes (stretch- include vegan, vegetarian filters if needed, stretch2- include cuisine selection)
- setup github repo
- preliminary readme

-delete/otherwise mark expired foods?
-sort fridge by expiration date not date entered?
