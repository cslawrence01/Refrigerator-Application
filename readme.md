# Refrigerator Recipe App 
Hackathon Team: Beaver Log'arithms
Date: Oct 9, 2022

For this Hackathon project, we created a web application that uses a Spoonacular API to generate food recipes. The user inputs his or her refrigerator foods along with the respective expiration dates. The program then generates possible recipes. 

We included the following features:
-The user may click a button to see which foods are already in the refridgerator
-A form and submit button than enables the user to add a ingredient, along with the expiration date, which is sent to the refridgerator database
-A form and submit button to remove a ingredient
-A submit button which computes the recipe and then displays the recipe on a separate HTML page

Technologies Used:
-Flask (Python3) for the back-end
-Bootstrap for the front-end design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
-Spoonacular API
